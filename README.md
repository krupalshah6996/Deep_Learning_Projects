1. Churn Modelling: In this project, dataset of churn's bank is used. The aim was to determine whether a customer of the bank 
would exit or close its bank account in the future based on past data of past customers. The dataset is given as churn_modelling.csv .
An Artificial Neural Network is designed in order to achieve this goal. The final outcome tells whether a given customer is likely
to exit the bank or not.

2. Image Recongnition: In this mini project, an Convolutional Neural Network model is designed in order differentiate between 
different images of cats and dogs.

3. Google Stock Price Prediction: In this project, dataset containing past 10 years of Google's stock prices (i.e. both opening and closing)
is used. The aim was to determine the future trends of this stock which would give rough idea to investors about its future prices.
In order to achieve this goal, we designed an Recurrent Neural Network model which would take Google's past 10 years of stoc prices
as input and would tell the likely stock prices of the stock in upcoming time.
